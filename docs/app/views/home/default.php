                        We are aimed at delivering the best web and mobile experience for all people around the world.
                        So far, project air has in framework, the css file for our design, a generic rest api and still counting. The Aim of this design is to be

                    <p style="text-align:left;">
                        We have made intensive studies on Google's material design, windows flat design, Apple iOS9 design and Ubuntu8 UI design patterns to comee up with the best best  modeern and clean design we possibly can. The design may be very similar to material at first but we keep evolving to a more clean and modern user experience at time goes on. We plan on releasing up to 10 templates for our UI design, for both website and web app. We are also focused on creating components and directives to be used in Google's latest angular framework for quick and easy access. We will be creating these components for our own use in the websites and web application projects we have plan, so it will be both professional and available for commercial use.

                        The Default font we use for our designs is BARIOL, with the size of 16px. Although this can be changed to your preference depending on what you seek to achieve. We plan on using other font for our headings since the bariol doesing really stands out as a an h tag. Other fonts that we've considered are Calibri, Ubuntu and RailWay. The Calibri font to us is mor generic for all type of web projects irrespective of the theme of the project. Ubuntu font brings a more technological experience and for that reason, we prefer to use such fonts for any templates with that in mind. The RailWay font came in as a perfect subsitute for the default bariol font in use for clean website UI but not for web application experience.
